    "text": "Houses in California can range from a few thousand dollars to hundreds of millions. If we look at the median price for each “block”, we can use a data set which is less skewed. It is interesting because of the range of prices, we might be able to find a model which can explain the relationship between median house cost and the attributes of the houses. So, can we find a model that can predict house cost?\n\n\n\nLooking at a map of the houses in California with information on the house price and population, we can see that areas close to the coast, like LA and San Francisco, have a higher cost while more inland areas have a lower cost.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince we are dealing with ordered pair data for location, it might be important to create a new variable which represents the distance to the coast. This could be obtained using Tableau.\n\n\n\nOur model will most likely use a linear model.\n\n\n\nWe could use modified data which could be represented as proportions or percentages. For example, we have totalRooms and totalBedrooms variables. If we consider a variable of percentage of rooms which are bedrooms, the numbers would be better represented. We could expect more expensive houses to have lower percentage of bedrooms compared to cheaper houses."

    "text": "The value of a house can be determined by a number of different factors, which includes: location, size, age and condition, income, and neighboring houses. When deciding on where to live, a buyer not only considers the house value but also the other different attributes of the house. For example, cities like San Francisco that are highly developed and don’t have much room to expand tend to have higher prices than cities with too much room to expand. Naturally, certain attributes will contribute to a higher house value. If a house is close to essential amenities such as grocery stores, shops, and restaurants, this will contribute to a higher house value. Furthermore, newer electrical and plumbing systems might also raise the value of a house.\nUsing data from the 1990 California Consensus and data from Coast Borders of the Continental United States, we wanted to model how Median House Value is affected by certain house attributes. Since California is known for its many coastal cities, we wanted to include “Distance to Coast” as an additional attribute. Also, since larger houses tend to have more bedrooms, we wanted to create a percentage variable that looked at the amount of Total Bedrooms in relation to the amount of Total Rooms.\n\n\n\nIn what ways do the attributes of a house affect the sales price of a house in California?\nStatistical Hypothesis : Distance to the Coast, Population, and Income all affect house prices.\n\n\n\nDistance : Closest distance to the coast(measured in miles)\nhousingMedianAge : Median age of a house within a “block”; a lower number is a newer building\ntotalRooms: Total number of rooms within a “block”\ntotalBedrooms: Total number of bedrooms within a “block”\npopulation : Total number of people residing within a “block”\nhouseholds : Total number of households, a group of people residing within a home unit, for a “block”\nmedianIncome : Median income for households within a “block” of houses (measured in tens of thousands of US Dollars)\nmedianHouseValue : Median House Value for households within a “block”(measured in US Dollars)\nperc_br : totalBedrooms/totalRooms\n\n\n\nUsing data from Coast Borders of the Continental United States, we created a new “Distance to the Coast” variable.\n\n\n\nHere, we have a table of summary statistics for each of our variables within the California Housing Value data set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nnumeric.mean\nnumeric.sd\nnumeric.p0\nnumeric.p25\nnumeric.p50\nnumeric.p75\nnumeric.p100\nnumeric.hist\n\n\n\n\nlongitude\n-1.195697e+02\n2.003532e+00\n-1.2435e+02\n-1.218000e+02\n-1.184900e+02\n-1.180100e+02\n-114.3100\n▂▆▃▇▁\n\n\nlatitude\n3.563186e+01\n2.135952e+00\n3.2540e+01\n3.393000e+01\n3.426000e+01\n3.771000e+01\n41.9500\n▇▁▅▂▁\n\n\nhousingMedianAge\n2.863949e+01\n1.258556e+01\n1.0000e+00\n1.800000e+01\n2.900000e+01\n3.700000e+01\n52.0000\n▃▇▇▇▅\n\n\ntotalRooms\n2.635763e+03\n2.181615e+03\n2.0000e+00\n1.447750e+03\n2.127000e+03\n3.148000e+03\n39320.0000\n▇▁▁▁▁\n\n\ntotalBedrooms\n5.378980e+02\n4.212479e+02\n1.0000e+00\n2.950000e+02\n4.350000e+02\n6.470000e+02\n6445.0000\n▇▁▁▁▁\n\n\npopulation\n1.425477e+03\n1.132462e+03\n3.0000e+00\n7.870000e+02\n1.166000e+03\n1.725000e+03\n35682.0000\n▇▁▁▁▁\n\n\nhouseholds\n4.995397e+02\n3.823298e+02\n1.0000e+00\n2.800000e+02\n4.090000e+02\n6.050000e+02\n6082.0000\n▇▁▁▁▁\n\n\nmedianIncome\n3.870671e+00\n1.899822e+00\n4.9990e-01\n2.563400e+00\n3.534800e+00\n4.743250e+00\n15.0001\n▇▇▁▁▁\n\n\nmedianHouseValue\n2.068558e+05\n1.153956e+05\n1.4999e+04\n1.196000e+05\n1.797000e+05\n2.647250e+05\n500001.0000\n▅▇▅▂▂\n\n\nDistance\n2.421828e+01\n3.097077e+01\n1.7774e-02\n4.211575e+00\n1.160305e+01\n3.012989e+01\n218.4472\n▇▁▁▁▁\n\n\nperc_br\n2.130745e-01\n5.802350e-02\n1.0000e-01\n1.754255e-01\n2.031807e-01\n2.398345e-01\n1.0000\n▇▁▁▁▁\n\n\n\n\nWe have provided a Correlation Heat Map of each the variables.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe visualized the relationships between two variables on a map of California. As expected, locations close to the coast tend to have higher median house values and higher median incomes compared to more inland areas. The percentage of bedrooms doesn’t seem to be related to distance to the coast.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, from a simple graph, we can see that there seems to be a negative correlation between Median House Value and Distance. That is, as distance to the coast increases, the Median House Value tends to decrease.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, we have an interactive graph that shows the relationship between Distance to the Coast and a given attribute.\nShiny Graph goes here :\n\n\n\nWe tested many different models, and had adjusted R.squared values ranging from 0.2 to 0.6. We settled on one model, which included all attributes found in the data set. We have provided a table of the four models that we considered.\n\\[medianHouseValue = \\beta_{0} + Distance * \\beta_{1} + medianIncome * \\beta_{2} + population * \\beta_{3} + households * \\beta_{4} + perc_br *\\beta_{5} \\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDependent variable:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmedianHouseValue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\n\n\n(2)\n\n\n(3)\n\n\n(4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistance\n\n\n-914.680***\n\n\n-1,208.841***\n\n\n-1,168.605***\n\n\n-1,140.064***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(31.279)\n\n\n(31.194)\n\n\n(29.661)\n\n\n(30.880)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmedianIncome\n\n\n43,749.860***\n\n\n36,571.690***\n\n\n36,474.330***\n\n\n39,048.580***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(641.946)\n\n\n(520.718)\n\n\n(493.876)\n\n\n(618.272)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npopulation\n\n\n-51.363***\n\n\n\n\n-55.808***\n\n\n-50.000***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(2.093)\n\n\n\n\n(2.150)\n\n\n(2.277)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhouseholds\n\n\n155.963***\n\n\n\n\n159.335***\n\n\n104.459***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(5.973)\n\n\n\n\n(6.116)\n\n\n(13.915)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nperc_br\n\n\n283,624.800***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(20,189.710)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhousingMedianAge\n\n\n1,105.245***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(76.971)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntotalBedrooms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n82.443***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(12.557)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntotalRooms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-9.475***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1.447)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstant\n\n\n-37,527.690***\n\n\n94,658.390***\n\n\n93,603.770***\n\n\n82,786.840***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(7,219.005)\n\n\n(2,498.292)\n\n\n(2,663.822)\n\n\n(3,127.239)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations\n\n\n6,278\n\n\n6,278\n\n\n6,278\n\n\n6,278\n\n\n\n\nR2\n\n\n0.637\n\n\n0.569\n\n\n0.613\n\n\n0.616\n\n\n\n\nAdjusted R2\n\n\n0.637\n\n\n0.569\n\n\n0.613\n\n\n0.616\n\n\n\n\nResidual Std.

So, we have provided the residual plot of the final model below. It is worth noting that there is a downward linear trend. With the information we had, we could not determine why this trend is there. But the residual plot tells us that although there was some error, this is an acceptable model of the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur final model had some issues but no model will be a perfect representation of the real-world situation. There are many factors related to the housing market in California, more than we could account for. Nonetheless, we still managed to get a decent Adjusted R-squared value from our final model. Furthermore, with each linear regression model, the plot of the residuals did not change much.\nRegarding our Research Question, we found that each attribute had a different effect on the Median House Value. Regarding our Statistical Hypothesis, Distance and medianIncome proved to be significant attributes. However, population did not prove to be as significant as we expected."
